=================================
Welcome to Stuka's documentation!
=================================

The :code:`Stuka` library is a that was originally built to incorporate our research into algorithms for optimization under uncertainty. However, we realized that our implementations have merit, both from the academic perspective of understanding implementation of these algorithms, as well as a method of generalizing access to traditional solvers. We hope that the library proves useful in your work and, as academics, we are eager to hear of your applications and your insights insights.
